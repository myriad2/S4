1. 
Currently, running convergence test in the original "ex2.lua"   leads "segmentation fault".
The fault comes with "for nG = 101,401,40 do S:SetNumG(ng) ... ". 
If you change the script to "for nG = 401,101,-40 do S:SetNumG(ng) ... ", you get no fault. However, the results is totally wrong.
You may test "my_ex2.lua" on your own.
I'll be glad if anyone knows the reason.

2. Running the original "fresnel.lua" file, I get all zero coefficients for all incident angles.
So, I add a Slab layer, which leads to correct results if for loops is not used.
When for loop is used, however, the coefficents will not change as the incident angle changes. 
I think this has the same root with the problem 1 that S4lua doesn't reallocate the fields.
I will test this point if possible.

3. 
Besides, I have a standalone S4lua-1.1.1-win32.exe file that can be run directly in Windows, I forgot the website I downloaded from. 
The  exe file is very robust. However, it runs very slow, roughly  10 times slower than the method I show in this fork.
Also, no parallel running even if S4.SolveInParallel is used.
