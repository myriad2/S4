Currently, running convergence test in the original "ex2.lua"   leads "segmentation fault".
The fault comes with "for nG = 101,401,40 do S:SetNumG(ng) ... ". 
If you change the script to "for nG = 401,101,-40 do S:SetNumG(ng) ... ", you get no fault. However, the results is totally wrong.
I'll be glad if anyone knows the reason.

Besides, I have a standalone S4lua-1.1.1-win32.exe file that can be run directly in Windows, I forgot the website I downloaded from. 
The  exe file is very robust. However, it runs very slow, roughly  10 times slower than the method I show in this fork.
Also, no parallel running even if S4.SolveInParallel is used.
